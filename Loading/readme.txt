Notes:
Chrome (and other browsers) recently updated their policy for audio feedback, meaning audio cannot be played in a non active browser window, therefore a few steps are required for the program to work correctly.


1: After opening the program make sure you click anywhere on the screen once to make it your active window.
2: Make sure you start (say begin/start) within 5 seconds of doing so, as otherwise the HTML5 codex shuts off microphone input.
